# and run the python script with different config files on a different schedule
# e.g. downloading balances every hour, but downloading klines only once a day
# 

# defining the modules to be run
# 'yes' means this module will run, 'no' means it wont
# instead of 'no', you can as well remove the line
modules:
  # downloading balances and creating a csv file with the details
  balances: yes
  # downloading daily snapshots. one line per day and saved in an csv file
